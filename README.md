<h1> Project Question </h1>

<h3> What factors impact the ACE violations at the largest hotspot? </h3>
<h1> Contextualizing our Question </h1>
<p> In this project, we kept these questions in mind: <b> How much do employees, students, and tourists impact the hotspot/ACE violations? </b>
<b>Is it commercial use? Car services? Related bus/train lines? Geographical? How are lanes structured? What demographic makes up these riders? What businesses are around these routes? Public/private schools? Universities?</b> We also compared and contrasted two hotspots [Financial District vs Queens College route] to understand which factors are universal across NYC and which are unique to the dense Central Business district. Finally, we discuss, given our findings, how can we notice these patterns and improve? </p>
